// How it works (T5a). Coast land is split into clusters (a cluster is one stretch of coast, about TIDE_CLUSTER_SIZE tiles). Each cluster
// gets a phase, 0 or 1, from the world seed. At the start of every round the schedule is read and the `flooded` tile state is put on the
// clusters whose turn it is and taken off the rest. A flooded tile produces nothing (the production pipeline already reads the state).
// Nothing here draws from `g.rng`: the clusters use a stream derived from `g.seed`, and the schedule after that is a plain formula of the
// round number. The same seed gives the same tides, and a host who edits the board before the game starts gets clusters for the edited board.
