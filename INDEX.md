# File Index

What every file does. Paths are relative to the repo root. Every source file starts with a `// MODULE: what | DEPENDS ON: a, b | USED BY: c, d` line (see `scripts/headers.mjs`; the two lists are generated, only the description is written by hand). The `src/` tables below are generated from those headers (description text only): run `npm run index` after you add, move, delete or re-describe a file; `tests/index.test.ts` fails when they are stale. To change a row, edit the file's header, never the table. The Root, Docs and `tests/` tables are still hand-written.

## Root

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | Scripts (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `typecheck`, `test`); depends on express and socket.io |
| `esbuild.config.mjs` | Bundles `src/server/main.ts` to `dist/main.js` and `src/client/main.ts` to `dist/public/app.js`; copies `public/` and `styles.css`; `--watch` restarts the server |
| `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript settings for `src` and `tests` (`strict` off) |
| `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore` | Two-stage Node 20 image, runs `dist/main.js` on port 3000 |
| `render.yaml` | Render host (Singapore, free plan, health check `/health`, auto deploy) |
| `.env.example` | Environment variables (`PORT`) |
| `public/index.html` | The single HTML page: name page, setup page, lobby, board, menus |
| `data/bot_training_logs.jsonl` | Bot training data written by `bots/trainingLog.ts` |
| `data/bots/_schema.md` | S0.15 cross-game bot memory & player profile JSON schema, caps, and Render portable code spec |
| `scripts/addons.mjs` | Addon list generator (`npm run addons`; `npm run addons:check` fails if stale). Scans `src/packs/<dlc>/*.ts` for exported `AddonDef` objects, validates pack prefixes, missing deps and cycles, and writes `src/packs/<dlc>/addons.generated.ts` in deterministic dependency order |
| `scripts/index.mjs` | Index tool. Rewrites the `src/` tables in this file from the `// MODULE:` descriptions (`npm run index`; `npm run index:check` fails if they are stale). Sections and headings are listed in `SECTIONS` at the top of the script |
| `scripts/headers.mjs` | Header tool. Every `src/**/*.ts` file starts with `// MODULE: what \| DEPENDS ON: a, b \| USED BY: c, d`. You write only the text; the two lists are computed from imports. `npm run headers` reports, `headers:write` fixes, `headers:check` is the CI form (`-- --strict` also fails on stale lists) |

| `viewState.test.ts` | R7a client state builder (`makeStateBuilder`): snapshot (`view.snapshot.json`) of what the turn player, another player and a spectator get, with Tidebound on and off; addon off, tech missing and lobby cases for the VIEW_DATA fields |
